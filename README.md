# About
A simple retro style game made using JavaFX. The name will change because I'm not good with naming stuff.

# Update
The game assets and their functionality have been added. 

# Aims For Now
- Allow the user to save/load/continue the game.
- Implement a timer when playing a level.
- Add leaderboards (for the fastest completion times).

# Notes About The Implementation
- The Smart Enemy's path is calculated by using A* Search (if the player is reachable).
- The player must equip items to use them (equipping a key to open a door etc.) with the exeption of tokens.
- The player is always at the centre of the screen (canvas). So, when the player moves towards the bounds of the level, nothing is shown out-of-bounds.

More will be added once all the intended features are implemented.
