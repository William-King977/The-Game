# About
A simple retro style game made using JavaFX. You are an ambitious treasure hunter who has discovered a castle that's loaded with treasure! Can you get past the guards and steal the treasure all for yourself? Let's find out!

# Notes About The Implementation
- Everything is coded in Eclipse IDE.
- File handling is done by text files.
- Enemies only move when you move.
- The Smart Enemy's path is calculated by using A* Search (if the player is reachable).
- The player must equip items to use them (equipping a key to open a door etc.) except for tokens.
- The player is always at the centre of the screen (canvas). So, when the player moves towards the bounds of the level, nothing is shown out-of-bounds.
