# About
A simple retro style game made using JavaFX. The name will change because I'm not good with naming stuff.

# Update
The game assets and their functionality have been added. 

# Notes About The Implementation
- Everything is coded in Eclipse IDE.
- Indents are 4 spaces.
- File handling is done by text files.
- The Smart Enemy's path is calculated by using A* Search (if the player is reachable).
- The player must equip items to use them (equipping a key to open a door etc.) with the exeption of tokens.
- The player is always at the centre of the screen (canvas). So, when the player moves towards the bounds of the level, nothing is shown out-of-bounds.
